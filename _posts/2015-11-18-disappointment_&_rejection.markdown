Learning to code is a mixed bag of emotions. Some days you feel like a total wizard, capable of anything even when you're solving the smallest of problems. Other days you feel inadequate. Not smart enough, not creative enough, not *good* enough. 

So far I've been able to work through those not so good feelings. I've pushed them aside to focus on working hard and learning everything I can. All year I've been working up the skills and courage to apply for a really exciting apprenticeship program. I thought I was a great fit and it would be my big break into development. This week I found out I didn't get in.

Here's another not so good feeling. Rejection. I felt crushed and still kind of do. I was so sure this would work out. I needed it to work out. Part of me felt deflated and wanted to give up when I got that news. But another part of me, a bigger part of me, knows that it's just fuel for me to work harder and land the next opportunity I find. I will become a developer. I'm bound and determined to keep learning and keep building. I won't let rejection crush me and that's exactly how I'm going to make it into this field.
