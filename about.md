Hi! Welcome to my code journey. I'm a web developer in training based in the Dayton, OH area. Currently I work in a non-technical role at a music publishing company, but much of my spare time is spent learning to code. On this blog I hope to describe my learning experiences, what works for me, and what I've struggled with. When I'm not at the computer, I enjoy bike rides, horror films, sci-fi television (talk to me about Orphan Black!), and baking.
