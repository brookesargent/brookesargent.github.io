I want to go ahead and write this post now so I don't get overwhelmed by the pressure of what my very blog post should be about. So here we go.

I've been talking about needing this blog for a while to have a place where I can write about what I'm learning, what's working for me, and what I'm struggling with. I attended a Girl Develop It Dayton class over the weekend. It was all about GitHub Pages and we learned quite a bit about Jekyll as well. It was just what I needed to get this up and running. I had tried before but struggled with implementing Jekyll, so thank you GDI!

I'm really excited to describe my journey, provide links to useful resources, and share some projects that I'll be working on. I hope you'll stay tuned!
