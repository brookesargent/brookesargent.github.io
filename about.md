Hi! I'm a web developer in training from Dayton, Ohio. Currently I work in a non-technical role at a music publishing company, but much of my spare time is spent learning to code. So far I've focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've also dabbled a bit in Ruby on Rails. When I'm not at the computer, I love going on bike rides, watching horror films, and playing video games.

I'm really excited to talk about my code journey on this blog - thanks for following along!
